# UnDKC3
Donkey Kong Country 3 Text Editor

This is a simple tool that extracts and inserts texts into the SNES game Donkey Kong Country 3.
It was just partially tested, if you have any problems just open a issue.
Please note that the tools doesn't update pointers or lengths (mostly due to laziness, also ohter issues),
so you may need to do this manually for now.

Read the usage to know how to use the tool. Just open the tool without any arguments to make it show up.
